## Play Coma

You wake up as a ghost with a mysterious voice telling you to return to your body while collecting your memories along the way. Traverse the caves, forest, roads, and more to find your story.


### Mechanics

As a ghost, you can only move around with the arrow keys and X to interact and talk (no attacking capabilities, so youâ€™ll have to navigate carefully around the harmful critters!). As a platform game, you will have to overcome obstacles, avoid the small creatures, and find and talk to the citizens of the region while you travel to find your unconscious body and lost memories.
